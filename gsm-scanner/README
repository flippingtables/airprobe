# scanner.py

A tool for capturing downlink broadcast traffic from BTS to MS.

This tool will perform a scan of all downlink channels downlink channels in the GSM900 band and dump then in a capture directory.
For each scan, and if an Android device with a GPS is plugged in, the tool will gather gps data, and dump it in the capture directory.
The GPS data is in the form of a json file, which can be parsed and extracted as necessary.

## Output
Each scan will result in a directory "$OUTPUT_DIR/20150626-1550/"
In each directory there is a list of "chanXX.cfile" files, and a "gps.json" file.
Each "chanXX.cfile" corresponds to the radio capture of that specific channel.
