# convert_cfile_to_xmlpcap.py

A tool for converting captured downlink broadcast traffic from BTS to MS to pcap xml files containing GSMTAP data.

## Output
Each scan will result in a directory "$OUTPUT_DIR/20150626-1550/pcapxml"
In each "pcapxml" directory there is a list of "chanXX.cfile.xml" files.
The "xml" files are cfiles which have been converted to "GSMTAP" UDP packages, 
which have been received by 'tshark' and dumped as pcap xml files.

Each "chanXX.cfile.xml" corresponds to the radio capture of that specific channel.

## PREREQUISITES:
Airprobe projects are compiled and installed.
UHD drivers are installed
Wireshark installed
tshark installed
